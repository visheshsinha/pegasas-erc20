### ERC 20 Token Standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

ERC-20 Token Standard => Fungible Assets
Fungible Assets ? Which can be exchanged for one another, like a one dollar bill can be exchanged for another one dollar bill.

#### Use Cases: 
Company Shares, Event Tickets, Virtual Currency, etc.

#### Main Functions: 
- Token Transfer
- delegated Transfer: Transfers assets to someone on behalf of someone, must be approved.

An ERC-20 Token is a Virtual Currency that lives under Ethereum Blockchain. Contrary to the native token Ether, anybody can create his/her own ERC-20 Token. When you create a token you can allocate as many units to yourself or anyone (with keeping in mind the tokenomics you designed). Each Token lives in its own smartcontract.

Note: We can create a token which does not respect the ERC-20 Standard, but if you do so, you cannot interact / deal with other tokens or exchanges which has the same standard. Like a private token for personal or inter-organisational use. Same thing can be done on BEP-20.
